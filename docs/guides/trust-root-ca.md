# Trusting the root CA certificate

The root CA certificate generated by Hetty is used for signing on-the-fly TLS
certificates when Hetty proxies with machine-in-the-middle (MITM) behavior. By
default, this root CA certificate isn't trusted by your system and browser. It
results in warnings and/or blocked access from your browser.

Aside from starting Hetty with the `--chrome` option (see: [Getting
Started](/docs/getting-started#run)), you can add the root CA certificate to
your system's trust store. The quickest way to do this is via a built-in
subcommand of Hetty:

```sh
hetty cert install
```

When invoked without options, it looks for the root CA certificate at
`~/.hetty/hetty_cert.pem`. you can use the `--cert` option to override this.

Depending on your OS, you'll be prompted for sudo access. `hetty cert` uses the
Go package [truststore](https://github.com/smallstep/truststore), in case you
want to inspect what it does under the hood.

If you don't feel comfortable granting privileged access to Hetty, you can also
_manually_ trust the root CA certificate (default location:
`~/.hetty/hetty_cert.pem`). Instructions vary per OS, but can be easily found
via a search engine.
